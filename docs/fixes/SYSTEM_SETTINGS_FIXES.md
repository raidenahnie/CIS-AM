# System Settings Fixes - October 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ AdminActivityLog Model Issue
**Problem**: The `auth()->id()` method was causing lint errors in the static log method.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the `log()` method to accept an optional `$adminId` parameter
- Added null check to prevent logging when no user is authenticated
- Updated method signature: `log($action, $description, $entityType = null, $entityId = null, $changes = null, $adminId = null)`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Models/AdminActivityLog.php`

---

### 2. ✅ Login/Logout Activity Logging
**Problem**: Login and logout actions were not being logged in the activity logs.

**Solution**:
- Added `AdminActivityLog` import to `AuthController`
- Added logging after successful login (admin users only)
- Added logging before logout (admin users only)
- Logs include user name, email, and action timestamp

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`

**New Log Actions**:
- `login` - When admin successfully logs in
- `logout` - When admin logs out

---

### 3. ✅ Workplace CRUD Activity Logging
**Problem**: Creating, updating, and deleting workplaces was not logged.

**Solution**:
- Added logging to `storeWorkplace()` method
- Added logging to `updateWorkplace()` method with change tracking
- Added logging to `deleteWorkplace()` method

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`

**New Log Actions**:
- `create_workplace` - When a workplace is created
- `update_workplace` - When a workplace is updated (tracks changes)
- `delete_workplace` - When a workplace is deleted

---

### 4. ✅ Workplace Assignment Activity Logging
**Problem**: Assigning and removing users from workplaces was not logged.

**Solution**:
- Added logging to `assignWorkplace()` method
- Added logging to `removeWorkplaceAssignment()` method
- Logs include user name and workplace name

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`

**New Log Actions**:
- `assign_user_workplace` - When a user is assigned to a workplace
- `remove_user_workplace` - When a user is removed from a workplace

---

### 5. ✅ Activity Logs Search Functionality
**Problem**: Search bar and action filter in activity logs were not working.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `getActivityLogs()` API endpoint to accept search and action parameters
- Added search across: description, action, IP address, admin name, and admin email
- Added action filter to filter by specific action types
- Added debounced search input (500ms delay)
- Added real-time filter dropdown
- Updated JavaScript to pass search and filter parameters to API

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`
- `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`

**Features Added**:
- Text search with 500ms debounce
- Action type filtering
- Search resets to page 1
- Filter updates automatically reload results

---

### 6. ✅ Action Filter Dropdown
**Problem**: Filter dropdown was missing many action types.

**Solution**:
- Added all logged action types to dropdown
- Updated action badge colors for new action types

**New Actions in Filter**:
- login
- logout
- create_user
- update_user
- delete_user
- create_workplace
- update_workplace
- delete_workplace
- assign_user_workplace
- remove_user_workplace
- update_admin_account
- failed_admin_update

**New Badge Colors**:
- `logout` - Gray
- `create_workplace` - Green
- `update_workplace` - Yellow
- `delete_workplace` - Red
- `assign_user_workplace` - Indigo
- `remove_user_workplace` - Orange

---

### 7. ✅ Functional Settings with Backend Storage
**Problem**: Security, Location, and Data Management settings were not functional (no backend storage).

**Solution**:
- Created `SystemSetting` model and migration
- Added settings table with key-value storage
- Implemented type casting (boolean, integer, json, string)
- Added default settings in migration
- Created API endpoints for getting and updating settings
- Connected frontend toggles and inputs to backend
- Settings now persist in database

**New Files**:
- `app/Models/SystemSetting.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_10_06_163029_create_system_settings_table.php`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`
- `routes/web.php`
- `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`

**Default Settings Stored**:
- `security_password_expiry` - Boolean (default: true)
- `security_2fa` - Boolean (default: false)
- `security_session_timeout` - Boolean (default: true)
- `location_gps_accuracy` - Boolean (default: true)
- `location_manual_entry` - Boolean (default: false)
- `location_default_radius` - Integer (default: 100)

**New API Endpoints**:
- `GET /admin/settings` - Get all settings
- `POST /admin/settings` - Update a setting

**JavaScript Functions Added**:
- `saveSetting(key, value)` - Saves setting to backend
- Event listeners for all toggle switches
- Debounced input handler for radius field (1000ms)

## Database Migrations Run

1. **2025_10_06_160439_create_admin_activity_logs_table.php** - Created activity logs table
2. **2025_10_06_163029_create_system_settings_table.php** - Created settings table with defaults

---

## New Routes Added

```php
// Activity Logs
Route::get('/admin/activity-logs', [AdminController::class, 'getActivityLogs']);

// Settings
Route::get('/admin/settings', [AdminController::class, 'getSettings']);
Route::post('/admin/settings', [AdminController::class, 'updateSetting']);
```

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Null Safety**: Added null checks in `AdminActivityLog::log()` method
2. **Change Tracking**: Workplace updates now track what fields changed
3. **Search Optimization**: Database queries use proper indexes
4. **Type Casting**: Settings properly cast to boolean/integer/json
5. **Debouncing**: Search and input changes use debouncing to reduce API calls

---

## Performance Notes

- Activity logs search uses indexed columns for fast queries
- Settings are cached in memory after first load
- Search input is debounced (500ms) to reduce API calls
- Radius input is debounced (1000ms) to prevent excessive saves
- Pagination limits results to 50 per page

---

## Security Enhancements

- All admin actions are now logged with IP address
- Failed admin account updates are logged separately
- Settings changes are logged for audit trail
- User agent information captured for each action

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Data Management Settings**: Backup and export buttons still show "coming soon" notifications (not implemented yet)
2. **Session Timeout**: Toggling session timeout setting doesn't actively enforce timeout (requires additional implementation)
3. **2FA Setting**: Two-factor authentication toggle saves but doesn't implement actual 2FA (requires additional setup)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement actual backup functionality for Data Management
2. Implement export functionality (CSV/PDF)
3. Add date range filter for activity logs
4. Add bulk actions logging for bulk operations
5. Implement session timeout enforcement based on setting
6. Implement 2FA based on setting
7. Add email notifications when critical settings change
8. Add setting change history tracking

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status

# Rollback if needed
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

## API Testing Examples
